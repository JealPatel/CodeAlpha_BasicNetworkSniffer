# CodeAlpha - Basic Network Sniffer 🕵️‍♂️

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project is part of my **Cyber Security Internship** at **CodeAlpha**. It is a basic **network sniffer tool built using Python and Scapy** that captures and analyzes live network traffic.

The main objective of this task is to understand how data flows through a network, examine packet structures, and observe protocol-level communication like TCP, UDP, and ICMP.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time packet capture from the network interface
- Displays:
  - Source IP Address
  - Destination IP Address
  - Protocol used (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
  - Timestamp of capture
- Written using Python and the Scapy library
- Lightweight and easy to run on local machines

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Library:** [Scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- **Platform:** Windows (requires Npcap or WinPcap)
